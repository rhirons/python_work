# python_work

Collection of scripts to help me learn python. I decided to learn by solving problems I had rather than going page by page through the various python books.

-py_encode.py-

Simple python script to batch convert video files in ffmpeg using the Nvidia hardware decoding & encoding libraries. The script will process all video files in a folder called batch and convert to h264 mkv files. The audio stream of the file will not be touched and simply copied.
